Deep Learning for Fraud Detection: A Neural Network Approach 

I recently completed a project focused on one of AI’s most critical financial applications: fraud detection. Rather than just building a model, I focused on solving the "needle in a haystack" problem—identifying fraudulent activity in highly imbalanced datasets where scams account for less than 1% of transactions. 
Using a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), I navigated the complexities of data normalization, resampling, and regularization to prevent overfitting. This experience pushed me to look beyond standard accuracy, prioritizing metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to ensure real-world reliability. 
This project was a powerful lesson in how responsible AI can be used to strengthen security and digital trust.
